                    Throughout human history, the weapons employed in warfare have been dictated by the available resources and technologies of a given era (Casadevall, 2012). Wars in ancient societies utilized stones, metals, leather, and wood for both offensive tactics and defensive protection. The mobility that horseback riding offered when the stirrup was adopted in Western Europe greatly improved the knights' ability to combat. World War I and World War II witnessed the rise of gunpowder, aircraft, chemicals, computers, and nuclear weapons to gain advantages against opposing countries. Simultaneously, research on the use of biological agents for warfare was ongoing in Japan and continued by the Americans post-World War II. The mid-20th century ushered in the period of biological revolution wherein powerful biotechnologies emerged for scientific progress and industrial growth in the pharmaceutical and medicinal fieldsâ€”which simultaneously opened the door to potential weapons of mass destruction. Given these ongoing advancements, the threat of potential biological warfare and bioterrorism remains a real and pressing concern.

                    Casadavall has identified infectious disease as one of the three major existential threats to humanity. While the 1972 Biological Toxic Weapons Convention was written to limit the use of certain bioweapons, a few countries did not sign the treaty. There is also no assurance that the signed countries will fully adhere to the treaty. Bioterrorism methods have become easier to achieve as biotechnology becomes more accessible, easier to operate, and cheaper (Jansen et al., 2014). Meanwhile, these advanced technological capabilities allow the development of a biological weapon, including mechanisms that hasten the spread and increase the lethality of disease. Terrorists may potentially use these weapons to instill fear and inflict mass casualties.
