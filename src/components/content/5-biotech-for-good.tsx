						Though biotechnology has been manipulated utilizing biological agents as a tool to cause
						destruction on public safety and health, it has also been innovating solutions that can
						counter these dangers.
					</div>
					<div>
						According to Lim et al. (2005), public health officials recognize the need for rapid and
						accurate detection as biothreat agents can be unpredictable. Reliable platforms must be
						sensitive, specific and accurately detect a wide range of pathogens including modified
						or unknown pathogens to also verify the occurrence of a bioterrorism event. Commercial
						tests including biochemical tests, immunological detection devices, nucleic acid via
						quantitative PCR and bioluminescence tests, in addition the new developing technologies
						like aptamers, biochip, evanescent wave biosensors, cantilevers, and living cells are
						methods to further improve detection speed and accuracy.
					</div>
					<div className="!pb-0">
						To support this, Lim et al (2005) describe the Laboratory Response Network structured
						four laboratory levels from A to D to ensure organized and effective handling of
						biothreat agents.

						Lim et al. (2005), further introduces different detection and developing technologies
						detecting and identifying these biothreat agents associated with bioterrorism and
						biowarfare. From sample processing to detection technologies, these wide variations of
						microbial agents are treated ensuring the minimization of the potential spread caused by
						these pathogens.
					</div>
					<h2 className="font-koulen text-2xl">Preparation</h2>
					<div>
						Firstly, the study introduced the sample processing wherein biological agents are put in
						a preparation before proceeding on the detection process. These include removal of other
						substances as they can interfere during the detection of biothreat agents, ensuring
						better accuracy and reliability of the detection technologies
					</div>
					<h2 className="font-dm_sans !pb-0 text-xl italic">Sample matrix processing</h2>
					<div>
						A method that prepares the sample matrix by separating, concentrating and purifying.
						Sample matrices can be on a variety of compositions the following are examples of
						specific sample types: food, water, human specimens (blood, urine, stool specimens,
						nasal and throat swab specimens), powders and soil, aerosols and surfaces. These sample
						types are commonly tested for the presence of biothreat agents, due to the variety of
						compositions, different sample preparation methods are required on each sample matrix
						like centrifugation, filtration, dielectrophoresis, immunomagnetic separation and
						nucleic acid extraction.
					</div>
					<h2 className="font-koulen text-2xl">Detecting technologies</h2>
					<div>
						Following the sample processing, the study proceeds to the different detection
						technologies which vary on specificity and applicability. From manual to advanced, each
						has their own strength and constraint on detecting and identifying the presence of
						biological agents. May it vary on the speed, specificity, type of biological agent or
						others may need further testing, understanding their usage helps to recognize their role
						in reducing these threats impacted by bioterrorism and biowarfare.
					</div>
					<h2 className="font-dm_sans !pb-0 text-xl italic">Biochemical Tests</h2>
					<div>
						Biochemical tests are categorized in manual and automated. Manual Biochemical tests
						where most machines used in local clinic and hospital laboratories are not built to
						detect biothreat agents; thus, labs follow step-by-step processes to reduce potential
						false results and act fast on removing biothreat agents. Using testing and presumptive
						agent identification protocols to identify the following bacterias such as Bacillus
						anthracis, Yersinia pestis. Francisella tularensis and Brucella spp. On the other hand,
						automated biochemical tests which are mostly are not developed enough for identifying
						and detecting biothreat agents however some new systems offers biothreat update package
						using pattern recognition mainly Substrate utilization pattern (fingerprinting) which
						uses VITEK and MicroLog, and Fatty acid profile which uses MDA Sherlock System.
					</div>
					<h2 className="font-dm_sans !pb-0 text-xl italic">Immunological detection devices</h2>
					<div>
						Immunoassay which is widely used in medical, pharmaceutical and food industries where it
						detects biothreat agents through targeting antigen to trigger immune response. Andreotti
						et al. made a comprehensive four core component of the immunoassay mainly{" "}
						<i>
							“(i) the antigen can be detected; (ii) the antibody or antiserum used for detection;
							(iii) the method to separate bound antigen and antibody complexes from unbound
							reactants; and (iv) the detection method.”
						</i>
						However it can only detect one analyte per assay, antibody quality limits the
						specificity and PCR and other DNA-based sensitivity levels are higher than immunoassay.
						However, there are platforms and devices used in immunoassays which are called “smart
						ticket” technology: Solid support platforms like Luminex xMAP, BV technology,
						Bio-detector, and DELFIA, and Lateral flow platforms.
					</div>
					<h2 className="font-dm_sans !pb-0 text-xl italic">
						Nucleic acid detection via quantitative PCR
					</h2>
					<div>
						QPR combines PCR amplification with simultaneous detection using fluorescence dyes.
						Specific detection format is a dual-labeled fluorogenic probe containing the fluorescent
						dye and quencher dye to enable the change in fluorescence whereas non-specific detection
						format is where fluorescence is bound to DNA when using DNA-intercalating dyes. The
						non-specific format is more cost-efficient than specific and useful for optimizing PCR
						conditions and checking primer specificity. Q-PCR is highly versatile in its
						application, it can be useful for quantifying presence or absence, rapid confirmation
						testing or monitor gene expression. However Q-PCR has its own limitation as the accuracy
						and identification of bacteria is limited to the bias inherent in nucleic acid technique
						and the presence of inhibitors can result in false negatives. Hence new advances are
						made: Q-PCR thermocycler platforms and PCR reagent kits for biothreat agents.
					</div>
					<h2 className="font-dm_sans !pb-0 text-xl italic">Bioluminescence detection</h2>
					<div>
						Widely applied in clinical, food and environmental settings to detect bacterial
						contamination. The most common example of bioluminescence detection is
						Luciferin-luciferase reaction where the amount of ATP correlates to the biomass
						proportionally. Since ATP is found in all living cells, the step by step process of
						eliminating ATP contamination from non-target sources is required involving the use of
						detergent to lyse the non-target cells so only the intended cells are monitored. Systems
						like Profile-1 hand-system paired with Filtravette sample processing unit to detect
						bioluminescence and remove non-bacterial ATP sources, these combined systems are also
						effective on detecting contamination on meat carcasses, test biological aerosols and
						identify Bacillus species spores in powder. However these methods lack specificity as it
						only indicates the presence of ATP-producing microorganisms, requiring further testing
						for serious threats.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2 className="font-koulen text-2xl">Developing technologies</h2>
					<div>
						Developing technologies can help in identifying and detecting biothreat agents, from
						biochemical detection to chemical and physical detection, these advanced developing
						sensor technologies are paired with transducers that can convert response into a signal
						suitable for analysis.
					</div>
					<h2 className="font-dm_sans !pb-0 text-xl italic">Biochemical detection</h2>
					<div>
						Involves measuring products and enzymatic activity of enzymes during microbial
						metabolism, though it tends to be less specific than antibody- and nucleic acid- based
						methods as the product and enzyme is also present in other organisms. One example of
						biochemical detection technology is electronic nose devices which employ transducers
						like conducting polymers with chemicals that react with specific volatile organic
						compounds or games. This sensor can also be used to detect multiple analytes, microbes
						in food and infections and are used by researchers to identify volatile organic
						compounds produced by bacteria or fungi. Though it can be rapid and sensitive, it
						requires complex pattern recognition software to interpret data and lacks specificity
						due to different microbes also producing similar volatile compounds. Conducting polymers
						which are organic polymers conduct electricity to detect biologically produced chemicals
						from microbial metabolism such as toxins, can be doped with enzymes, antibodies or other
						biomolecules as it targets biological compounds like glucose, urea, and cholesterol
						which are useful as biochemical detectors.
					</div>
					<div>
						Some biosensors can detect bacterial toxins through the inhibition of enzymes such as
						portable sensors for anatoxin-a, a toxin produced by a certain cyanobacteria that uses
						electrochemical transducers to detect the activity of acetylcholinesterase though it can
						be nonspecific since other compounds also inhibit the acetylcholinesterase activity. To
						compensate, scientists have created mutated versions to increase sensitivity. Another
						biosensor is β-Galactosidase activity with amperometric detection which is used to
						quantify fecal coliform group of bacteria like E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae which
						enhanced specificity through electrodes functionalized with antibodies or phage to lyse
						bacteria followed by the amperometric detection of β-Galactosidase activity.
					</div>
					<h2 className="font-dm_sans !pb-0 text-xl italic">Tissue and cell-based detection</h2>
					<div>
						Used to identify biothreat agents using intrinsic response to detect toxins and
						infectious foreign substances to a specific type of cell with a sensor containing action
						potential signal, typically measured by electrode or optical detector. The cells may
						originate from unicellular organisms or tissue types like nerve or heart cells and it
						can be either primary or immortalized. Biosensors use cells from neurological and
						cardiac tissues to detect harmful substance like biological threat agents, some examples
						are cardiomyocytes — genetically engineered to respond selectively to a specific
						functional activity, neuronal cells — an automated biosensor that responds to the
						biological toxins tetrodotoxin and tityustoxin. However these biosensors are only
						limited on expired toxins and are not capable to shape or sequence recognition like
						antibody and nucleic acid sensors but can be advantageous when the threat is unknown.
					</div>
					<div>
						Another example is B lymphocytes, a cell found in the human that displays surface
						antibodies acting as pathogen receptors. Although undeveloped, researchers like Roder et
						al. have enhanced the system through aequorin and pathogen-specific surface antibodies.
						It may provide increased specificity to the cell-based system, it still faces the
						antibody cross-reactivity problem and has the same storage and maintenance as the other
						cell-based system. Chromatophores, found in cold-blooded animals that are responsible
						for pigmentation and change color when animals are exposed to biologically active
						substances like pesticides, neurotransmitters and bacterial toxins which can be observed
						using a microscope or spectrophotometer. Chromatophores from fish do not grow thus it
						does not need to be replaced frequently and has an ability to detect harmful chemicals,
						biological toxins, toxin-producing pathogens and other biologically active agents.
					</div>
					<h2 className="font-dm_sans !pb-0 text-xl italic">Immunological detection</h2>
					<div>
						Antibody-based and similar affinity probes are technologies that utilize the immune
						system specificity to target agents of interest through shape recognition technologies
						that detect a wide range of biothreat agents. Research about immunological detection is
						focused on improving sensitivity and specificity of antibodies however other types of
						shape recognition technologies are under investigation. Using affinity probes can
						potentially recover live organisms. The following are examples of antibodies, affinity
						probes and detectors: Antibodies and fragments Aptamers and peptide ligands, Flow
						cytometry, Biochip arrays, Surface plasmon resonance-based biosensors, Evanescent-wave
						biosensors, Cantilever and acoustic wave and Quantum dots and upconverting phosphors.
					</div>
					<h2 className="font-dm_sans !pb-0 text-xl italic">Chemical and Physical Detection</h2>
					<div>
						Utilize biosensors that detect physical and chemical properties of the target analyte
						like mass spectrometry, Raman spectrometry, and intrinsic fluorescence/luminescence. One
						method of chemical and physical detection is the multi wavelength UV/visible
						spectroscopic method which uses light-scattering and absorbing to differentiate
						vegetative cells and spores but it is nonspecific and needs extensive sample preparation
						on a non absorbing medium to produce a clean target. Mass spectrometry, particularly the
						MALDI-TOF method, identifies the molecule by weight. It can detect mainly proteins from
						bacteria and viruses, intact bacterial cells and spores like Bacillus thuringiensis and
						Bacillus atrophaeus. MALDI-TOF method is a fast system that works only with small sample
						volume, requires little sample preparation and is capable of identifying all the types
						of biological agents. Despite being the most used approach, it requires a highly
						concentrated sample, needs to develop complex fingerprints on every target and lacks
						specificity in mixed targets. FLow field-flow fractionation can improve MALDI-TOF/mass
						spectrometry to help in separating articles on the mixed targets.
					</div>
					<div>
						Another chemical and physical detection method is the Electrospray ionization Fourier
						transform ion cyclotron resonance (EIS-FTICR) that is used to analyze alleles such as
						variable-number tandem repeats and single-nucleotide polymorphisms but require DNA base
						pairs shorter than 200. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is another method that
						studies nucleic acids, pathogens, and toxins and requires multiple fingerprints on each
						target analyte. Methods by Bell et al. (adding sodium sulfate and thiosulfate) and Zhang
						et al. (used silver firm) are used to detect dipicolinic acid and improve sensitivity.
						SERS method can differentiate between viable and nonviable organisms and specific toxins
						in mixed samples and incorporated a biochip platform that used antibodies to capture
						target analytes that detect listeria and legionella species, bacillus species spores,
						cryptosporidium parvum and cryptosporidium meleagridis. The last method mentioned is the
						Near-infrared SERS method that identifies different spores like Bacillus
						stearothermophilus, strains like Escherichia coli and urinary tract infections.
